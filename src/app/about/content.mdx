## Hi! üëã

This is Shahab.

A software developer,  
currently digging into classics,  
and playing around with Functional Programming and Design.

Most fluent with JavaScript,  
good with Elixir,  
exploring Rust, Haskell, Lisp (family).

Apart from code, I'm a fan of  
coffee,  
photography,  
design,  
and all things creative.

Here, I hope to share some of my findings, explorations, thoughts, and learnings.
