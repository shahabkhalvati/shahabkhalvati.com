More to be done, yet the core should stand. <ExternalLink title="Micro.blog" href="https://micro.blog" /> served its purpose, but it was the time to take full control.

The focus would now be on

- refining details
- perfecting post view
- data import
- managing long-form content
- post separation / differentiation
- rss feed

Basically a step forward.

Built with <ExternalLink title="Next.js" href="https://nextjs.org" /> and for those interested, code and raw content is accessible on [Github](https://github.com/shahabkhalvati/shahabkhalvati.com).  
As always, thoughts are welcome and appreciated,  
and hope to see you more often.
