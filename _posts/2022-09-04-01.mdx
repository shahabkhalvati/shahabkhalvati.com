Was checking some audio setups and noticed I perceive the music and the sound differently with my eyes closed.  
From the details,  
to sound stage,  
to feeling.  
The whole experience!  
It’s more lively,  
and more vibrant.

Then tried to replicate it with open eyes, while being more focused and mindful.  
A tid closer, but not quite there…  
It’s just not the same.

Then started checking how the internet feels about it, and looks like I’m not alone.  
There have been some experiments around the topic, and the observation is  
even being inside an empty, dark room,  
the difference in experience is still there!

Didn't expect this
