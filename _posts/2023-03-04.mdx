\[alarm sound ⏰\]

it’s time.  
you wish you could sleep a bit more.

you turn on the kettle  
weight the coffee  
grind it  
not boiling yet…

so exhausted you don’t move  
you just stay there and watch

brewing starts.  
that aroma
makes you excited.
gives you the will and energy to make a perfect brew

you pick the cup
smell it
and the first smile of the day appears on your face.

you hit it to the edge of the table
the cup is on the floor
and coffee everywhere
