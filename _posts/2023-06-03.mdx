Paolo Maldini is one of the greatest defenders in football history. His game clips are filled with impossibly long and accurate sliding tackles that make getting past him virtually impossible.  
He once famously said:

> “If I have to make a tackle, then I have already made a mistake.”

In the same way,  
a boss at work, or a leader, sometimes has to make hard decisions;  
which often suggests they made a mistake or two earlier on.
