summary: |
  `Y = f => (x => x(x))(x => f(y => x(x)(y)))`  
  Saw it and couldn't make much sense of it. On my nth try though…

Let's start by reading why Y-Combinator accelerator group went with the name:

> The Y combinator is one of the coolest ideas in computer science. It's also a metaphor for what we do. It's a program that runs programs; we're a company that helps start companies.

"A program that runs programs" seems cool, but what is it like?  
`Y = λf.(λx.f(x x))(λx.f(x x))`  
And in JavaScript:  
`Y = f => (x => x(x))(x => f(y => x(x)(y)))`.

How is this helpful?  
Essentially, it helps us write recursive code when recursion is not supported by the programming language; and so is not needed with most modern ones.  
Though let's explore it more together, it'll be fun!

Let's start with the classic recursion example, factorial:

```
const factorial = n => (n === 1 ? n : n * factorial(n - 1))
factorial(5) // 120
```

This works because the function refers to itself by name. What if that's not possible?
Imagine mapping over an array, using an anonymous function.  
Or need for a recursive arrow function to be passed as a property. Like:

```
<Computation
  input={5}
  calculation={n => (n === 1 ? n : n * factorial(n - 1))}
/>
```

Won't work.

Again, yes, there are workarounds, and most of them are better solutions;  
But we are here for fun.

So let's use the Y-combinator:

```
<Computation
	input={5}
	calculation={Y(factorial => n => n === 1 ? n : n * factorial(n - 1))}
/>
```

How does it work?  
We need to learn some calculus; but not now. Let's tackle if differently. The hard way.

Move back a bit.  
Imagine a function.  
We want more of it.  
We call it, and we get even more.  
`f => f.f`, or `f => f(f)`.

But a function definition does not do anything. We need to run it, and for that, it requires an argument.  
But what?  
How about itself?

```
const loop = f => f(f)
loop(loop) // Maximum call stack size exceeded
```

Execution, Forever!  
We are getting there.  
But one may ask, aren't we still using the name to implement recursion?  
Yeah…  
Yet, similar to how: `(x => x + 1)(3) // 4`  
we could write: `(fn => fn(fn))(fn => fn(fn))`.  
We're back.

We have an infinite execution – a recursive function without a base-case to halt it.

Let's revisit our factorial function:  
`n => n === 1 ? n : n * factorial(n - 1)` but what factorial? It's not defined.  
We need a function to call, and cannot reference it by name. Alternative?  
We could pass it as a parameter:  
`factorial => n => n === 1 ? n : n * factorial(n - 1)`.

Recall loop function from before: `f => f(f)`. Applying the same idea, we would have:

```
factorial => n => n === 1 ? n : n * factorial(factorial)(n - 1)
```

We ran `loop` like: `loop(loop)`. So too for our factorial function, we should:  
`factorial(factorial)(5)` and get back `120`!

So far we have:

```
const rec_factorial =
	factorial => n => n === 1 ? n : n * factorial(factorial)(n - 1)

rec_factorial(rec_factorial)(5) // 120
```

Let's refactor it using the `loop` function we had:

```
const loop = f => f(f)

const factorial = fact => n => n === 1 ? n : n * loop(fact)(n - 1)
loop(factorial)(5) // 120
```

Two problems though. It's not quite right to

- know we should pass `factorial` to `loop` to execute it on `loop(factorial)(5)`. It belongs to `factorial` implementation.
- mix `loop` with `factorial`'s internal logic. `loop(fact)(n-1)` is mixing different matters; it's noisy.

For the first problem, we move `loop` into the `factorial` implementation:

```
const loop = f => f(f)
const factorial = fn => loop(fact => n => n === 1 ? n : n * loop(fact)(n - 1))(fn)

factorial(5) // 120
```

Note we can remove `fn`, similar to:

```
const increase = x => x + 1
[1, 2, 3].map(x => increase(x))
[1, 2, 3].map(increase)
```

We can write:

```
const loop = f => f(f)
const factorial = loop(fact => n => n === 1 ? n : n * loop(fact)(n - 1))

factorial(5) // 120
```

And for the second issue, we could use a helper:

```
const loop = f => f(f)
const factorial = loop(fact => n => {
	const f = loop(fact)
	return n === 1 ? n : n * f(n - 1)
})
```

The return line is more readable now, but the function…  
It contains the logic for both recursion,  
and factorial computation.  
How about we separate them?

```
const loop = f => f(f)
const recursion = fn => loop(g => n => {
	const loop_g = loop(g) // replace g, with loop(g), so fn does not need to know about it

	return fn(loop_g)(n)
})

const factorial_logic = fact => n => {
	return n === 1 ? n : n * fact(n - 1)
}

const factorial = recursion(factorial_logic)

factorial(5) // 120
```

Much better.  
And we should be able to remove `n` inside `recursion` function, right?

```
const recursion = fn => loop(g => {
	const loop_g = loop(g) // Maximum call stack size exceeded
	return fn(loop_g)
})
```

Our intermediary function `loop_g` is getting executed, but it should have waited for a parameter (the one we just removed).
Let's fix it:

```
const recursion = fn => loop(g => {
	const loop_g = n => loop(g)(n)
	return fn(loop_g)
})
```

Improve the styling now and make things inline:

```
const loop = f => f(f)
const recursion = fn => loop(g => fn(n => loop(g)(n)))
const factorial = recursion(fact => n => n === 1 ? n : n * fact(n - 1))

factorial(5) // 120
```

Now remove the `loop` function by changing:

- `loop(g)` to `g(g)`
- `loop(g => ...)` to `(f => f(f))(g => ...)`

We would have:

```
const recursion = fn => (f => f(f))(g => fn(n => g(g)(n)))
// as we saw  Y =  f => (x => x(x))(x =>  f(y => x(x)(y)))
```

Aha!
