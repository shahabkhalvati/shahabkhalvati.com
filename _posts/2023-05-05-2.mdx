My two cents on styling:

- It sure depends on the context and requirements. Usually:
- a minimal global css file, that handles overall look and feel for the website. Ex: fonts and typography, spacing, responsive design targeted media queries, colors, links and hovers.
- Global classes for common use cases (ex: image and caption in a blog, meta texts, code)
- CSS in JS for specialized cases, unique components, samples, styles related to code heavy components.
- Prefer CSS to JavaScript for styling when possible. Hovers, media queries, transition animations and the sort, all should be handled natively by CSS rather than JavaScript – don’t reinvent the wheel.
