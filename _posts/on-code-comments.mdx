“Code Smell” is a signal.
A hint from the code itself, that there might be a deeper issue with it.
Not an immediate problem though,
but rather a potential long-term affect on the code quality and maintainability.

Here’s a thought:
code comments, often seen as helpful, are actually a code smell.
Why?
Because they are either
redundant – adding to the mental load,
or an indication of the fact that the code is overly complicated — too much context, too many tasks being done, mismatched abstraction levels, etc.

Comments aren’t inherently bad, they have their place. But
if there’s a comment, there’s often an opportunity to improve the code.
