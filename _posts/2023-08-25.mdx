We set this baseline of “normal” in our mind, and we keep comparing it with how it is right now;\
And develop strong feelings towards what is not normal.

Normal\
is to feel full, relaxed, and happy.\
If it is so, right now, then that's normal.\
Won't feel a thing.

If not, we feel hungry.\
Something unplanned comes up, we feel stressed.\
Someone does something we didn't imagine,\
a hardship comes up,\
we feel sad, and angry.

What if we set our expectations and baseline like:\
Life is a set of disappointments, and a collection of miseries.\
Every second not so, a chance to be happy and grateful.\
The rest?\
It's just life…\
Normal life, as it is supposed to be.\
No hard feelings.
